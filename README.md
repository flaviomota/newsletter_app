# Newsletter App

This is a simple newsletter app that allows users to sign up for a newsletter and receive emails.

After that I used the MailChimp API to create a new list and add the user to that list.

It's a single page web site, and on the front end it looks incredibly simple, but on the backend it's got some powerful functionality that will allow you to sign people up to your mailing list.
